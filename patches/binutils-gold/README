This patch is for binutils' gold ld linker, v2.27.  It achieves two things:

1. Adjusts aarch64's TLS layout to conform to x86-64's layout
2. Print detailed size and alignment information for all data/function symbols
   in the generated binaries.

# TODO add information about how the layout is changed, i.e., is it inverted?


Binutils 2.32

This patch introduces a new --popcorn-tls argument to LD to force the
x86_64 target to a common TLS model with ARM64. This is necessary
because that TLS model is not compatible glibc at present. When
linking with musl, be sure to add --popcorn-tls to ensure backwards
compatibility with TLS.
