This is a very simple python/GDB script to dump the offset of a struct

Currently used to dump struct stat

1. Compile st.c with your favourite C compiler and library, remember -g

2a. run the dump python/gdb script -- it will output the offsets

2b. alternatively, run the dumpC python/gdb script -- it will write a C program on stdout

3b. copy and paste the program in a C file, compile it with your favourite C compiler and library

4b. run the compiled program -- it will output the offsets
